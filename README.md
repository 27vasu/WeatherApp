# WeatherApp
This is a simple and responsive Weather App built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. It fetches real-time weather data from a public API and displays the current weather conditions based on the city entered by the user.

Technologies Used
HTML5 – for the basic structure of the app

CSS3 – for clean and responsive styling

JavaScript – for handling API requests and dynamically updating the UI

OpenWeatherMap API – for fetching live weather data (can be swapped with any API)
